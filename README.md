# Action.JS

*JavaScript library for developing interactive web applications, inspired by ActionScript 3*

Action.JS is released under the MIT license.

### Get the Code

For now, either clone the repository or [download it as a zip](https://github.com/ericschmidt/Action.JS/zipball/master).  
You can use the current build at build/action.js or build/action.min.js directly, or if you make edits, you'll have to concatenate the source files - see the [wiki](https://github.com/ericschmidt/Action.JS/wiki/Building-from-Source) for more information on building the library.  
Once it's in a suitable condition I'll put the build on my website so it can be hotlinked to or downloaded alone.

### Examples

Demos can be found in the demos folder, use demo.html to run them. More examples are being made as the library is being updated!

### Documentation

A full reference and examples will be available on the [wiki](https://github.com/ericschmidt/Action.JS/wiki) soon!

**A Note on Sound**

I'm not sure I'm going to implement sound into Action.JS; ideally I would, to keep everything together in one library, but I've been using [Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) lately and it's simple and effective, so for now I recommend using a third-party sound library. But I very well may include sound in Action.JS in the future.
