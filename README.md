# Action.JS

*JavaScript library for developing interactive web applications, inspired by ActionScript 3*  
Released under the MIT license.

### Get the Code

For now, either clone the repository or [download it as a zip](https://github.com/ericschmidt/Action.JS/archive/master.zip).  
You can use the current build (not minified) at build/action.js directly, or if you make edits, you'll have to concatenate the source files.  
Once it's in a suitable condition I'll put the build on my website so it can be hotlinked to or downloaded alone.

### Examples

Demos can be found in the demos folder, use demo.html to run them. More examples are being made as the library is being updated!

### Documentation

A full reference is coming soon enough...

**A Note on Sound**

I'm not sure I'm going to implement sound into Action.JS; ideally I would, to keep everything together in one library, but I've been using [Buzz](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/) lately and it's simple and effective, so for now I recommend using a third-party sound library. But I very well may include sound in Action.JS in the future.
